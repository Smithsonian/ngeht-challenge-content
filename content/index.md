Welcome to the next-generation Event Horizon Telescope Analysis Challenge!

The [ngEHT project](https://www.ngeht.org) will add new capabilities and more stations to the existing
[Event Horizon Telescope](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/).

These analysis challenges will help us understand the performance of
different imaging algorithms on simulated data from the expanded
array, and will help us assess how different array options might
affect our ability to achieve our science goals.

## Current Status

We're organizing the simulated data for the first challenge.
